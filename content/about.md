Compiler toolchain engineer at ByteDance. Work on LLVM and Clang.

 - Responsible for compiler instrumentation based dynamic program analysis tools, such as AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer.\
   Deploy them for analyzing our data center software.\
   Found, analyzed and fixed a countless number of memory errors and data races in server-side software.
 - Heavily involved in switching to Clang/LLVM toolchain from GCC, keeping data center software with up-to-date Clang/LLVM toolchain.
 - Also track and improve compilation time for our server-side software, e.g. [#88477](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/88477), [#93451](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/88477), [#96188](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/88477)

I am knowledgeable of LLVM middle-end optimizations and keep learning the LLVM optimizer.\
I have less experience with LLVM backend but would like to (and plan to) learn more about LLVM backend design and implementation.

Feel free to contact me directly with any questions.
